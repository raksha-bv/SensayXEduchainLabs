- **Interactive Q&A**: Natural conversation flow for asking questions and getting immediate, contextual answers
- **Progress Tracking**: AI monitors learning milestones and suggests improvements

#### üîß **Technical Implementation**
```javascript
// Example: Creating personalized AI replica for each user
const createUserReplica = async (userId, learningPreferences) => {
  const replica = await sensayAPI.createReplica({
    name: `${userId}-Blockchain-Tutor`,
    shortDescription: "Personal blockchain learning assistant",
    greeting: "Hi! I'm your personalized blockchain tutor. How can I help you today?",
    ownerID: userId,
    llm: {
      provider: "openai",
      model: "gpt-4o"
    }
  });
  
  // Train replica with blockchain-specific knowledge
  await trainReplicaWithBlockchainKnowledge(replica.uuid);
  return replica;
};
```

## Key Features

### üîπ Solidity Practice Arena
A LeetCode-style coding platform where users get AI-generated problem statements suitable for Smart Contract Development. They can write, compile, and test Solidity smart contracts with **personalized AI replica feedback** and real-time code validation.

![Solidity Arena](https://github.com/EduchainLabs/Showcase/blob/main/SolidityCodeArena.png)

### üîπ NFT-Certified Courses
Earn verifiable NFT certificates upon course completion. Each course includes theoretical knowledge & hands-on challenges where users can practice with **AI replica guidance**. Each certificate is minted via IPFS using Pinata and tied to the user's wallet‚Äîmaking achievements permanent and tamper-proof.

![NFT Certificates](https://github.com/EduchainLabs/Showcase/blob/main/Courses.png)

### üîπ Company Challenge System
Tackle real-world Web3 problems posted by companies with **AI replica support**. Successful submissions trigger smart contracts that automatically distribute bounty rewards to the solver's wallet. Companies can promote their organization and get solutions to Smart Contract development problems.
